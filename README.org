* affe.el - Asynchronous Fuzzy Finder for Emacs

This package provides functionality similar to ~fzf~ but written in pure Elisp.
The Consult frontend transforms the input string to a list of regexps. These
regexps are passed to the backend via the ~emacsclient~ protocol. The backend
starts another process generating lines (for example find or grep). These lines
are filtered using the regexps submitted by the frontend. The filtering is
performed by ~all-completions~ for performance.

** Configure the fuzzy regexp compiler

 The default regexp transformation is quite weak. You may want to use Orderless
 instead.

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq affe-regexp-function #'orderless-pattern-compiler
         affe-highlight-function #'orderless-highlight-matches)
 #+end_src

** Available commands

 - ~affe-grep~
 - ~affe-find~
